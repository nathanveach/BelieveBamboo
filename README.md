cart into bootstrap modal
	- modal will only show current cart items and pic and price maybe?
	- there will be 2 buttons at bottom: proceed to checkout && view cart 
		- view cart button will lead to full cart page checkout to customer path


finesse show page to maybe show reviews? or specs or something just add more shit lol

need an after checkout page with order summary or something idk


*believebamboo navbar brand unaffected by hover/focus 
*make checkout timer more modual (low priority)

comment all code for understandability


get mailer to also send product titles in order summary blahblah
	- it works just needs to be cleaned up somehow






-Customize mailer to separate fulfilled orders and abandoned carts(this might take a while do later)
